this is an AI-slop plugin but it actually works pretty damn well
that being said it probably has inefficiencies or redundancies, i am not a well-versed programmer.
i'm pretty sure if you do /reload it will cause memory leaks.. so.. don't do that.

starts a scavenger hunt every hour on server start-up (or if you use /hunt force, doesn't reset timer)
it chooses 5 random items (no way to set weight currently maybe later) and 1 random reward (command execution, also no way to set weight atm) 
the random hunted items & rewards are configurable in config.yml

the scavenger hunt is a competition/race style hunt, only 1 player can win per round.
players will see their individual completion progress on the holograms.

to set up:
>place hopper
>/hunt sethopper
>???
>profit
